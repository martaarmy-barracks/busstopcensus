The bus stop has no kind of formal waiting area. The “boarding area” is the turning lane in the middle of the street!!! There is a poison ivy plant growing on the fence of the grass area near the bus stop sign. When it’s raining outside the entire area is nothing but mud and trash every where. And when it rains cars splash water on you. I hate this stop!!!","FLAG"
